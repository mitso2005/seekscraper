# Welcome to Dimitri's Seek Webscraper (Work in Progress)

This is a super simple python program that uses selenium to scrape through seek job postings and calulate the frequency of any specified key words. Its intended use is for finding the most in demand programing languages for software engineering roles however it can be used to find how often any key word appears for any type of job.

The prgoram is simple:

You input the type of job you wish to scrape in the comand line (eg. input: software egineer, will scrape: https://www.seek.com.au/software-engineer-jobs) and follow it up with the key words you'd like to scrape for (eg. Python, Javascript, C). The program will then tally up the number of times these key words appear for that type of job (capped at one appearance per posting) and outputs the results (eg. Python: 10, Javascript: 3, C: 8).
